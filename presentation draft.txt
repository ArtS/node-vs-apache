Node.js

Overview
Server-side Javascript (Gogle V8)
Single-thread
Asynchronous, evented I/O
Runs *nix, actively developed on Windows

Architecture
Chrome V8 Javascript Engine

	V8 compiles all JavaScript to native code, no intermediate language, no interpretation etc. Crazy fast

	Two compilers:

∘ one that runs fast and produces generic code (full-godegen)
∘ one that doesn't run as fast but does try to produce optimized code.

	The first time V8 sees a function, it parses it to the Abstract Syntax Tree but doesn't actually do anything with it.

	When function is run  first time, V8 runs the generic compiler without a lot of optimisation (called full-codegen). 
	But after things have started up, it kicks off a profiler thread to see how things are going, and what functions are hot.

	Once V8 has identified that a function is hot and has collected some type feedback information, it tries to run the augmented AST 		through an optimizing compiler.

libev for event management
libeio for async file/network I/O
c-ares for async DNS
OpenSSL for TLS/SSL

Issues: 
	- Some issues with large data structures - V8 does not seem to be able to allocate more than 512MB/1GB (x86/x64) on the heap
	- Copying strings from V8 heap is slow - my test for serving static files confirm that - Apache tends to outperform node.js here


Performance

[nginx vs apache charts]
[php vs node chart]
mention that apache is a sort of humpty-dumpty



Asynchronous vs Multi-threaded

Issues with multi-threading
Events/callbacks are natural in Javascript


Developing for Node.js
NPM - THE package manager for Node.js

• Installing things as simple as 'npm install underscore'
• Flexible dependency resolution mechanism - each lib gets its dependencies without clashes

Debugging with Chrome Dev tools
Cloud9
vim !


Ecosphere
Backed by Joyent
Very active community - lots of contributors both into Node.js codebase and libraries/tools
Release every one or two weeks
Lots and lots of libraries and web frameworks
Bringing Node.js to Windows - development started recently, things look promising, backed up by Microsoft.
